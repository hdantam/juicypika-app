### A Website of all the Things I Love 

This is my unofficial official website where I put together things from all my entertainment/social media accounts I use, games I love playing, and other hobbies I enjoy (aptly named after the username I use in all of them). This will eventually be a collection of all the stuff I love/have loved to do online for the past decade or more.

### The Pages
There are 7 main pages I will have set up involving making API or database calls to gather information about my accounts and usage. Those include:

- MyAnimeList (you will be able to go through everything in my anime list)
- League of Legends (track my account progress)
- Art (put in a database)
- Genshin Impact (character information)
- Twitter (unsure yet)
- Youtube (unsure yet)
- Discord (maybe bots I make and messaging features here, and possibly link to any future servers I make)

In addition to these there will also be a way for people who come to this site to contact me with any requests/questions. 

### Frameworks/Libraries/Languages
This website was made using React along with Firebase being used for backend database and cloud functioon calls to external APIs. The styling with CSS is being done entirely by me without the use of any external css frameworks just so I can get a better hang of its functions. 

### Deployment
This app will likely not deploy for a few weeks until I have at least half of the pages I want to include running and going. I have restarted on this project multiple times but I finally feel like I have gotten a good enough start to keep me motivated on it.
