# Juicypika App

### A Website of all the Things I Love 

This is my unofficial official Website where I put together things from all my entertainment/social media accounts I use, games I love playing, and other hobbies I enjoy. This will eventually be a collection of all the stuff I love/have loved to do online for the past decade or more.

### The Pages
There are 7 main pages I will have set up involving making API or database calls to gather information about my accounts and usage. Those include:

• MyAnimeList (you will be able to go through everything in my anime list)
• League of Legends (track my account progress)
• Art (put in a database)
• Genshin Impact (character information)
• Twitter (unsure yet)
• Youtube (unsure yet)
• Discord (maybe bots I make and messaging features here, and possibly link to any future servers I make)


### Deployment
This app will likely not deploy for a few weeks until I have at least half of the pages I want to include running and going.
